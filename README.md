# Heat-Equation-solver
This repo contains basic 1d and 2d heat equation solvers. The code is very primitive and doesn't use any special libraries like scipy. Only matplotlib and numpy is used for simulation and visualisation purposes. Apart from the code there is also explanation for how we arrive at the differential schemes used in the code.
